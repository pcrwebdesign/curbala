# tips:
# - can specify url at top level and override in environment-specific block as needed.
# - be sure http or https is specified as needed for each unsimulated environment.
# - block needed for each of your application's environments.
# - do not recommend running test unsimulated : unit tests should be hitting external APIs.
# - development makes no connectivity assumptions and, by default, runs simulated.
#   set/manipulate action instance simulated_response implementations as needed.
#   if service is available in development mode, set 'simulate' to false and specify url.
#   - standard disclaimer about multiple developers testing concurrently in unsimulated mode : things could get weird...
# - can specify additional parameters that an action instance can plug in via its invoke_action() implementation.
#   handy for plugging in other environment-specific, or somehow appropriately specifiable, goo.

# url: http://SERVICE_NAME_DOWNCASE base service url for all environments

test:
  simulate: true
  url: http://test SERVICE_NAME_DOWNCASE base service url

development:
  simulate: true
  url: http://development SERVICE_NAME_DOWNCASE base service url

production:
  simulate: false
  url: http://TODO__SPECIFY_LEFT_JUSTIFIED_ENVIRONMENT_DEPENDENT_PORTION_OF_SERVICE_URL_IN___config__SERVICE_NAME_DOWNCASE.yml
